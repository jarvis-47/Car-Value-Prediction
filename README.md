# Car Price Prediction Web Application
Welcome to the Car Price Prediction web application project! Dive into a comprehensive guide that takes you from raw data to a fully functional web-based application. This project is not just about predicting car prices, but also an excellent opportunity to grasp diverse data science concepts and tools in a practical context.

## Project Overview:
**Model Building:** Using a car prices dataset from Kaggle, we employ sklearn's ensemble methods and linear regression to develop a prediction model. Along this journey, you'll experience:
* Data loading and cleaning
* Outlier detection and removal
* Feature engineering
* Dimensionality reduction
* Hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV

**Flask Backend:**
* Develop a Python Flask server
* Utilize the trained model to handle HTTP requests for predictions

**Frontend Development:**
* Design a sleek web interface with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
* Users can input car attributes (e.g., distance travelled, year, brand) and receive price predictions in real-time.

**Technologies & Tools:**
* Languages: Python
* Data Manipulation: Numpy, Pandas
* Visualization: Matplotlib
* Model Development: Sklearn
* Development Environments: Jupyter Notebook, Visual Studio Code, PyCharm
* Web Backend: Python Flask
* Web Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
